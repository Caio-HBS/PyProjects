# tic_tac_toe.py

A Python implementation of the classic Tic-tac toe game.

## Usage

```sh
# cd into the folder (if you're not into it already)
cd Tic-tac_toe

# create a virtual environment for python and activate it (only valid for Linux and MacOS)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# run the main python script
python3 main.py
```

### For Windows users

If you're using Windows, you'll need to use different commands, but the script to be used is the same `main.py` located in the main project folder.

Please use this guide to create and activate a virtual environment in Windows:
